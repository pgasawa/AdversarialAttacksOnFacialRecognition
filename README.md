This repository contains the source code for our Final Project for the New Member Education Program of the Machine Learning @ Berkeley Club (Fall 2021).

Our project concerns the generation of adversarial attacks through existing methods and exploration of new methods. We explore a number of methods that are outlined below.

# Adversarial Examples with an FGSM (Fast Gradient Signed Method) Attack

The code for this example was sourced originally from: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/adversarial_fgsm and based on the paper "Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples" by Goodfellow, et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572).
